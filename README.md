> **4:3 Look to the West, Forth comes fire, and a horde, and the Kingdoms burn**

**Murkwürst is burning** is a simple village hexcrawl built for FoundryVTT and inspired by the Alles Wird Brennen adventure. It can be used as is or incorporated into other campaigns. Some adventure opportunities are provided to the gamemaster in the Hiding in the shadows table but any reason can be used to explore this damned village. The adventures includes two indoors locations to explore, the Duke's Estate and the Crypt which has been inspired by the Gregor's Folly adventure

## FoundryVTT Integration

**Foundry Install Manifest**: TODO

- Enabling the module should import all the necessary compendium items for the adventure. 
- A button at the top of the compendium has been added to re-import the compendium items when necessary. 
- The FoundryVTT integration includes a dashboard for all the roll tables. Those actions are configured to only appear on their corresponding scene. 
- The start scene is The Village.
- It's strongly advised to enable the Perfect Vision Module.
- It's encouraged to enable the FXMaster module for a better atmosphere.
- You may need to reset the fog of war in the village scene before starting.
- Combats in the village can occur in one of the battle scenes provided, or in a theater of mind which is preferable for some monsters, such as the Archibishop of Flames or the Furious mob.
- All scenes should activate at the recommended starting location.
- Two versions of actors exist, one for the village which has a smaller token size and the other for the battle scene.
